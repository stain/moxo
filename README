Moxo S3 DAV Proxy Server

This is a first go on two issues:

a) a WebDAV server based on apache-commons-vfs
b) an Amazon S3 provider backend for apache-commons-vfs

The WebDAV server is semi-complete in a sense that it works well for most tests in the
listmus test suite except for property handling which is virtually non-existing.

The VFS backend is started and provides read-only access. I have managed to browse through
my test backup on S3 using MacOSX own Finder DAV client.

INFO:

Subversion: http://thinkberg.com/svn/moxo/trunk

The maven build process is not yet fully completed, so to get this running a little bit
of tweaking is necessary, unless you use IntelliJ IDEA and maven idea:idea to create
an IDEA project file.

To run either the MoxoJettyRunner or the MoxoTest you need to include the src/main/resources
directory in your classpath. Also copy the file moxo.template.properties and edit it to
include your Amazon S3 access information as well as the bucket to use. Right now the bucket
must already exist and contain files uploaded using the Uploader or Synchronize from Jets3t.

Define the system property "moxo.properties" to point to your moxo.properties file:

java -cp ... -Dmoxo.properties=moxo.properties com.thinkberg.moxo.MoxoJettyRunner

TODO:

- Create an executable JAR with all required libraries. The Main is already prepared to do
  that but I have not yet fully understood how to get maven to package the jars right next
  to the compiled classes.
- Add write access to the VFS backend.
- Much more ...
